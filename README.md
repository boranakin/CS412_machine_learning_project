# Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify bug reports into different severity levels based on their descriptions.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`
  - `raw/`: Raw data files
  - `processed/`: Preprocessed data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for each step
- `models/`: Trained models
- `reports/`: Reports for EDA and model performance

## Instructions
1. Run the data exploration notebook to understand the data.
2. Run the data preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the data.
3. Run the model training notebook to train the machine learning models.
4. Run the model evaluation notebook to evaluate the model performance.
5. Run the generate submission notebook to create the Kaggle submission file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib
- Jupyter Notebook
